This manifesto addresses the often overlooked question in web design: Are we designing for our audience or simply following trends? It calls upon web designers to **BREAK FREE FROM CONFORMITY** rediscover their unique voices, and create user-centric digital experiences that resonate deeply with brands' audiences. This manifesto seeks to redefine web design as a transformative force that transcends trends and leaves a lasting impact on the digital landscape.
